
ABOUT THE CORONA SDK SAMPLE CODE


These samples have been adapted for cross-platform deployment in the following ways:

* Automatic content scaling for multiple screen dimensions, using an optional config.lua file with either "letterbox" or "zoomEven" scaling modes specified.

* Sound files in both .caf and .mp3 formats, which are the preferred event sound formats for iOS and Android, respectively.

* Android device permissions added to build.settings where appropriate (for example, Android requires specific permissions for GPS, Internet access, or using the camera).

In production software, you may want to use higher-resolution assets for the iPad and other large-screen devices, but sharing assets between the iPhone and Android phones generally works well.

Note that OpenFeint is currently only available on iOS, so these samples will not work on Android or the Corona Simulator.
